<!-- # ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: 

  Researched answer:


1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github? *

  Your answer:

    -The difference between Git and Github is that Git is local and Github is remote. Git is a software where you interact with your own personal computer. Github is a cloud like platform where you make changes online.

  Researched answer:

    -Through my research I learned that the difference between Git and Github is indeed the fact that Git is local and Github is remote. To further go on detail, Git is a graphical user interface keeping track of your past actions retaining the source code during the software development process through your own local personal computer. Github in the other hand is a way you store your Git files via online, a service focused on centralizing source code with places in which codes are stored to a directory and essentialy a hosting service that can be available or accesed to the public allowing you to share your Git and other Developers are able to pair program or work/alter on your Git codes remotely.


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value? *

  Your answer: 

    -In my brief experience learning how to code this week. I remember that the JavaScript operator that will return a Boolean value is a Relational operator.

  Researched answer:
 
    -Through my research I learned that the JavaScript operator that will return a Boolean value is in fact a Rational operator. Relational operator returns a Boolean value after analyzing and contrasting if the expression is true.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value? *

  Your answer:

    -In my brief experience learning how to code this week. I remember that the an index is where you may find an array or strings and value is where you can find more details/information regarding the index.

  Researched answer: 

    -An index is a location of an array or string. The main difference between the two is that index and value is that the index is the whereabouts of a string or an array and value is where you may find the information of index location.


4. What is iteration? *

  Your answer:

    -In my brief experience learning how to code this week. I remember that an iteration is a repetition process of a code instructions you want to be displayed in your terminal a certain amout of time you want it to be.

  Researched answer:

    -Through my research I learned that an Iteration is in fact when you want to be specific with the certain amount of times you want a set of code instructions to be displayed in a repetitive way until stoppped or met conditions are satisfied.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person? *

  Your answer: 

    -In my brief experience learning how to code this week. I remember that the roles each person plays while pair programming are Driver and Navigator. There are several proper pair programming techniques, such as the pomodoro method which consists of switching back and forth every 25 minutes. Allowing your partner to freely express their ideas, double checking codes, typos, spelling  and most importantly communication is key to proper pair programming techniques.

  Researched answer:

    -Through my research I learned that proper pair programming techniques roles are indeed both the Driver and the Navigatior/Operator. I also found out that the proper pair programming techniques are very important in the field because it helps executes the workflow tasks expeditiously as a team. Prodactivity can be done when the Driver and Navigator plan out a blueprint, a path to follow throughout the day if you will. Long drives gets draining, like pair programming switching back in forth in a timely paced intervals also called as Pomodoro method allows both to get a breather and most importatly a chance for a hands on experience. The truth of the matter is that nobody wants to be stuck in a long car drive with someone unpleasant and have no regards to anybody but themselves and that's where etiquette plays in, like pair programming both party must be abe to show empathy, understanding, patience and most importantly not being so domineering.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:

    -Through my research I learned that Higher Order Functions are returned function or arguements that are taken. This function compatibly works on other functions.


2. Jest:

    -Through my research I learned that Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that is capable of interacting with Node, TypeScript, React, Babel and more when working on projects featuring a more simplified style to coding.


3. Objects:

    -Through my research I learned that Objects can be considered as pretty much everything besides the primitives.


4. Method:

    -Through my research I learned that Method is essentially a value that equates to nothing of an object property.


5. Classes:

    -Through my research I learned that Classes are used to create objects as a blueprint that manipulates data.
